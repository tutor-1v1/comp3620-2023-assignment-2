    Parameters
    ----------
    var : str
        The name of the variable which has just been assigned.
    assignment : Dict[str, str]
        A Python dictionary of the current assignment. The dictionary maps
        variable names to values. The function cannot change anything in
        `assignment`.
    gamma : CSP
        An instance of the class CSP, representing the constraint network
        to which we are looking for a solution. The function cannot change
        anything in `gamma`.

    Returns
    -------
    pruned_list : Optional[Pruned]
        In the case that the algorithm detects a conflict, the assignment and
        CSP should remain unchanged and the function should return None.

        Otherwise, the algorithm should return a pruned_list, which is a list
        of (variable, value) pairs that will be pruned out of the domains of
        the variables in the problem. Think of this as the "edits" that are
        required to be done on the variable domains.

    ----------

        AC-3 is used for preprocessing, `var` will be `None`.
