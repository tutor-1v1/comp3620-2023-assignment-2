""" This file implements an iterative, stack-based backtracking search.

    It uses the given select_unassigned_variable, order_domain_values, and
    inference (constraint propagation) functions to perform the search.

    You can look in this file if you are curious about how the search algorithm
    works, but it should not be required to complete the assignment.
